The Luggage is a project to create a wrapper to make Apple PKG format
packages.

It does not use the PackageMaker GUI, but it does require that the developer
tools be installed so it can call the command line version.

Advantages:
You can get peer review of a package by examining the diffs between versions
of your Makefile. No more wading through a zillion annoying GUI panes.

Full documentation can be found at http://wiki.github.com/unixorn/luggage/

Example packages can be found at https://github.com/unixorn/luggage-examples

Note : This version adds a command line option to remove the application prior to installation (app2luggage.rb).
